                <p>The town’s art festival is in crisis! The centerpiece of the event - the Fandango Vase made by the world famous ceramicist Lucas Landon, vanished from its locked pedestal last night. With the festival opening tonight, the pressure is on to recover it. Witnesses reported seeing a shadowing figure near the plaza, and the thief seems to have left a trail of clues hidden across nearby stores. </p>
                <br><p>A guest visited the studio last night asking odd questions about glaze durability. After they left, the owner found something suspicious on the workshop table.</p>

            <div class="key blurred" data-key-number="1">
                <p>You earned a picture of a small shard of pale blue ceramic, matching the missing vase!</p>
                <br><p>The staff remember someone nervously buying a handbag yesterday (one big enough to hide something inside). They kept glancing over their shoulder as if afraid of being followed. The next morning, staff found something under the checkout counter. </p>

            <div class="key blurred" data-key-number="2">
                <p>You found a picture of a wrinkled receipt for the handbag purchase, paid in cash and signed with the initials M.L. </p>
                <br><p>A rushed customer came in yesterday asking for blue fabric patches and looked like they were covered in dust. They dropped something near the register.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="key blurred" data-key-number="3">
                <p>You found a picture of a tiny blue button, speckled with clay dust the same shade as the vase. </p>
                <br><p>The jeweler remembers someone in a long dark coat fiddling with display cases. Their sleeves snagged on a jewelry stand before they hurried out. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="key blurred" data-key-number="4">
                <p>You found a loose dark fabric thread with bits of glitter and clay residue.</p>
                <br><p>Find out the ending at the tent!</p>
